                Self-motivated, <strong><em>expert level problem solver</em></strong> looking for a challenging position within the larger content management and/or technical writing eco-system.

                With <strong><em>more than eight years of working experience within the field of SOP (Standard Operating Procedure) and technical documentation</em></strong>, you can rest assured that I would hit the ground running. As an added <strong>bonus,</strong> I'm quite <strong><em>comfortable with most modern web technologies/frameworks</em></strong> and equally comfortable speaking with business-folk, tech-folk and end customers alike.
